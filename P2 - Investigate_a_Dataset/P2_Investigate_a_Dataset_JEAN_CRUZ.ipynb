There were 1051 movies that made no profit.\n","- Profit increased over years. Mostly of the increase came after the year 2000.\n","- Runtime decreased over years. Indicating that movies got shorter as the years went by, probabily indicating that people after 1990 with other distractions becoming more popular (like TV and internet) don't have that much time to spend on movies.\n","- The top#5 companies by revenue reliesed 1241 movies and they were spread across multiple genres, which *Drama, Action, Comedy and Thriller* representing 50% of them.\n","- There is a positive correlation between Budget and Revenue (0.56) wich does not mean a strong correlation between those two variables. Altough, its not a strong correlation, budget can be used as a predictor to revenue.\n","- There is a positive correlation between Budget and Revenue (0.28) wich means a weazk correlation between those two variables. So, runtime is not a good predictor to revenue.\n","\n","### Limitations\n","- I've lost some of the data in the data cleaning steps where the dataset did not have the revenue and budget of the movies, which has affected our analysis by reducing the number of movie samples; \n","- Data provided it is not up-to-date (revenue and budget are calculated to 2010);\n","- Budget and revenue column do not have currency unit;\n","- I was not able to calculate the exact impact of each production company on budget and revenue, since the data is concatenated within all companies in one row, the best fisible option was to assume that all production company had the same weight in budget and revenue."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Qp_LssoqIdUE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":743},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1628081363044,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":16444,"user":{"displayName":"Jean
