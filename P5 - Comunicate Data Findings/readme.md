occured in 2007 in the United States. Data can be fpound here:

## Summary of Findings

- Distance and airtime are strongly positive correlated, this can be expected because the longer the distance the longer it will take to a flight to complete it. I was able to also check that arrival delay have positive correlation with departure delay and by that we can infer that when a flight has a departure delay the longer will be its arrival delay;

- Distance and Delay Elapsed are not strongly correlated;

- Arrival or departure delays are not related to the flight distances;

- Every company has big outliers (Shit happens) regarding delay Elapsed. But the quartiles from all companies are around 0-100 minutes. Some companies like SkyWest Airlines and United Airlines don't havy any delay. Weird!

- In 2007 there were more delays in June, July and August. Probabily this was the busiest time of the year, since it is summer in the US;

- Delay type does not change when we consider distance vs total delay time;

 - Departure delay is the most commom form of delay. SouthWest and American Airlines are the company with the higher number of delays, probably because they have more flights.


## Key Insights for Presentation

- On average all companies had low Elapsed delays per flight. Actually most companies had negatie Elapsed Delay which meant the flights actually spent less time than scheduled;

- The distributions of Departure Delay was right skewed and takes rather higher values, the Arrival Delay is right skewed as well but takes rather lower values;

- The airports of Pierre and Nantucket had the most delays placing the number #1 in the top#10 most departure delayed airports in US in 2007;

- In 2007 there were more delays in June, July and August. Probabily this was the busiest time of the year, since it is summer in the US.
